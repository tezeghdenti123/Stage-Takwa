If you would like to work within some of the UK's most impressive facilities and in a role which provides excellent careers progression opportunity, we want to hear from you! Location: Aldermaston, near Reading (Berkshire) Package: £37,860- £53,000 per annum (depending on your suitability and level of experience) Closing Date: 31st July 2024 What's Orion? Orion is a high energy density physics experimental facility that enables AWE scientists and physicists to improve their understanding of nuclear warhead science. Experts are able to apply a model-based approach to researching the performance, reliability and safety of the nuclear deterrent - in the absence of live testing since the UK's ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1996. AWE has historically used lasers to replicate the physical conditions found at the heart of a nuclear detonation, albeit on a minute scale. The Orion facility was commissioned as a replacement for the HELEN laser facility, which operated from 1979 to 2009. By recreating the huge pressures and high temperatures (up to 10 million degrees, which is similar to temperatures found at the centre of the Sun) that happen at the heart of a nuclear explosion, the facility is also able to replicate the centre of stars and large planets. This makes Orion a valuable tool for astrophysicists or scientists working in nuclear fusion, which is the process where atoms combine to release a huge amount of energy. Nuclear fusion reactions power the Sun and other stars.
